struggle adjust things improve drive . motivation facilitated coaching leaders , changing environment , finding multiple reasons motives something , realistic achievable . high achieving athletes likely motivated achieve success rather motivated avoid failure78 . reversal theory motivation states human behavior experienced eight states , four sets two . motivational state four pairs present time . reversal theory supporting research connecting psychological physiological phenomena states . purposeful reversals less desired , useful , state increase performance endurance . arousal stress may utilized unique helpful way use theoretical framework . theory well supported studies several continents variety sports . recovery injuryedit sport psychologists may also deal helping athletes recover psychological consequences resulting injury . athletes , especially professionals , risk injury kinds exercisers , process recovering injury , varying effects different kinds injuries important component sport psychology research . additionally , sport psychologist interested differences athletes may elicit stronger psychological reaction injury , risk injury . example , research
