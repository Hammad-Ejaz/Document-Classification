time travel mechanical means . time travel physics theories , notably special general relativity , suggest suitable geometries spacetime specific types motion space might allow time travel past future geometries motions possible . technical papers , physicists discuss possibility closed timelike curves , world lines form closed loops spacetime , allowing objects return past . known solutions equations general relativity describe spacetimes contain closed timelike curves , gdel spacetime , physical plausibility solutions uncertain . many scientific community believe backward time travel highly unlikely possible . theory would allow time travel would introduce potential problems causality . classic example problem involving causality grandfather paradox , postulates travelling past intervening conception ones ancestors causing death ancestor conception frequently cited . physicists , novikov deutsch , suggested sorts temporal paradoxes avoided novikov selfconsistency principle variation manyworlds interpretation interacting worlds . general relativity time travel past theoretically possible certain general relativity spacetime geometries permit traveling faster speed light , cosmic strings , traversable wormholes , alcubierre drives . theory general relativity suggest scientific basis possibility backward time travel certain unusual scenarios , although arguments semiclassical gravity suggest quantum effects incorporated general relativity , loopholes may closed . semiclassical arguments led stephen hawking formulate chronology protection conjecture , suggesting fundamental laws nature prevent time travel , physicists come definitive judgment issue without theory quantum gravity join quantum mechanics general relativity completely unified theory . different spacetime geometries theory general relativity describes universe system field equations determine metric , distance function , spacetime . exist exact solutions equations include closed timelike curves , world lines intersect point causal future world line also causal past , situation described time travel . solution first proposed kurt gdel , solution known gdel metric , others solution requires universe physical characteristics appear , rotation lack hubble expansion . whether general relativity forbids closed timelike curves realistic conditions still researched . wormholes main article wormhole wormholes hypothetical warped spacetime permitted einstein field equations general relativity . proposed timetravel machine using traversable wormhole would hypothetically work following way one end wormhole accelerated significant fraction speed light , perhaps advanced propulsion system , brought back point origin . alternatively , another way take one entrance wormhole move within gravitational field object higher gravity entrance , return position near entrance . methods , time dilation causes end wormhole moved aged less , become younger , stationary end seen external observer however , time connects differently wormhole outside , synchronized clocks either end wormhole always remain synchronized seen observer passing wormhole , matter two ends move around . means observer entering younger end would exit older end time age younger end , effectively going back time seen observer outside . one significant limitation time machine possible go far back time initial creation machine34 essence , path time device moves time , would allow technology moved backward time . according current theories nature wormholes , construction traversable wormhole would require existence substance negative energy , often referred exotic matter . technically , wormhole spacetime requires distribution energy violates various energy conditions , null energy condition along weak , strong , dominant energy conditions . however , known quantum effects lead small measurable violations null energy condition , many physicists believe required negative energy may actually possible due casimir effect quantum physics . although early calculations suggested large amount negative energy would required , later calculations showed amount negative energy made arbitrarily small . , matt visser argued two mouths wormhole induced clock difference could brought together without inducing quantum field gravitational effects would either make wormhole collapse two mouths repel . , two mouths could brought close enough causality violation take place . however , paper , visser hypothesized complex roman ring named tom roman configuration n number wormholes arranged symmetric polygon could still act time machine , although concludes likely flaw classical quantum gravity theory rather proof causality violation possible . approaches based general relativity another approach involves dense spinning cylinder usually referred tipler cylinder , gr solution discovered willem jacob van stockum49 kornel lanczos50 , recognized allowing closed timelike curves51 analysis frank tipler52 . cylinder infinitely long spins fast enough long axis , spaceship flying around cylinder spiral path could travel back time forward , depending direction spiral . however , density speed required great ordinary matter strong enough construct . similar device might built cosmic string , none known exist , seem possible create new cosmic string . physicist ronald mallett attempting recreate conditions rotating black hole ring lasers , order bend spacetime allow time travel . fundamental objection time travel schemes based rotating cylinders cosmic strings put forward stephen hawking , proved theorem showing according general relativity impossible build time machine special type time machine compactly generated cauchy horizon region weak energy condition satisfied , meaning region contains matter negative energy density exotic matter . solutions tiplers assume cylinders infinite length , easier analyze mathematically , although tipler suggested finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves rotation rate fast enough , prove . hawking points theorem , cant done positive energy density everywhere ! prove build finite time machine , need negative energy . result comes hawkings paper chronology protection conjecture , examines case causality violations appear finite region spacetime without curvature singularities proves cauchy horizon compactly generated general contains one closed null geodesics incomplete . one define geometrical quantities measure lorentz boost area increase going round closed null geodesics . causality violation developed noncompact initial surface , averaged weak energy condition must violated cauchy horizon . theorem rule possibility time travel means time machines noncompactly generated cauchy horizons deutschpolitzer time machine regions contain exotic matter , would used traversable wormholes alcubierre drive black hole . quantum physics main article quantum mechanics time travel nocommunication theorem signal sent one location received another location , long signal moving speed light slower , mathematics simultaneity theory relativity show reference frames agree transmissionevent happened receptionevent . signal travels faster light , received sent , reference frames . signal could said moved backward time . hypothetical scenario sometimes referred tachyonic antitelephone . quantummechanical phenomena quantum teleportation , epr paradox , quantum entanglement might appear create mechanism allows fasterthanlight ftl communication time travel , fact interpretations quantum mechanics bohm interpretation presume information exchanged particles instantaneously order maintain correlations particles . effect referred spooky action distance einstein . nevertheless , fact causality preserved quantum mechanics rigorous result modern quantum field theories , therefore modern theories allow time travel ftl communication . specific instance ftl claimed , detailed analysis proven get signal , form classical communication must also used . nocommunication theorem also gives general proof quantum entanglement used transmit information faster classical signals . interacting manyworlds interpretation variation hugh everetts manyworlds interpretation mwi quantum mechanics provides resolution grandfather paradox involves time traveler arriving different universe one came argued since traveler arrives different universes history history , genuine time travel . accepted manyworlds interpretation suggests possible quantum events occur mutually exclusive histories . however , variations allow different universes interact . concept often used sciencefiction , physicists david deutsch suggested time traveler end different history one started . hand , stephen hawking argued even mwi correct , expect time traveler experience single selfconsistent history , time travelers remain within world rather traveling different one . physicist allen everett argued deutschs approach involves modifying fundamental principles quantum mechanics certainly goes beyond simply adopting mwi . everett also argues even deutschs approach correct , would imply macroscopic object composed multiple particles would split apart traveling back time wormhole , different particles emerging different worlds . experimental results certain experiments carried give impression reversed causality , fail show closer examination . delayedchoice quantum eraser experiment performed marlan scully involves pairs entangled photons divided signal photons idler photons , signal photons emerging one two locations position later measured doubleslit experiment . depending idler photon measured , experimenter either learn two locations signal photon emerged erase information . even though signal photons measured choice made idler photons , choice seems retroactively determine whether interference pattern observed one correlates measurements idler photons corresponding signal photons . however , since interference observed idler photons measured correlated signal photons , way experimenters tell choice made advance looking signal photons , gathering classical information entire system thus causality preserved . experiment lijun wang might also show causality violation since made possible send packages waves bulb caesium gas way package appeared exit bulb nanoseconds entry , wave package single welldefined object rather sum multiple waves different frequencies see fourier analysis , package appear move faster light even backward time even none pure waves sum . effect used send matter , energy , information faster light , experiment understood violate causality either . physicists gnter nimtz alfons stahlhofen , university koblenz , claim violated einsteins theory relativity transmitting photons faster speed light . say conducted experiment microwave photons traveled instantaneously pair prisms moved ft . apart , using phenomenon known quantum tunneling . nimtz told new scientist magazine time , violation special relativity know . however , physicists say phenomenon allow information transmitted faster light . aephraim m. steinberg , quantum optics expert university toronto , canada , uses analogy train traveling chicago new york , dropping train cars station along way , center train moves forward stop way , speed center train exceeds speed individual cars . shengwang du claims peerreviewed journal observed single photons precursors , saying travel faster c vacuum . experiment involved slow light well passing light vacuum . generated two single photons , passing one rubidium atoms cooled laser thus slowing light passing one vacuum . times , apparently , precursors preceded photons main bodies , precursor traveled c vacuum . according du , implies possibility light traveling faster c , thus , possibility violating causality . absence time travelers future many argued absence time travelers future demonstrates technology never developed , suggesting impossible . analogous fermi paradox related absence evidence extraterrestrial life . absence extraterrestrial visitors categorically prove exist , absence time travelers fails prove time travel physically impossible might time travel physically possible never developed cautiously used . carl sagan suggested possibility time travelers could disguising existence recognized time travelers . versions general relativity suggest time travel might possible region spacetime warped certain way , clarification needed hence time travelers would able travel back earlier regions spacetime , region existed . stephen hawking stated would explain world already overrun tourists future . advertisement placed edition artforum , advertising krononauts event several experiments carried try entice future humans , might invent time travel technology , come back demonstrate people present time . events perths destination day mits time traveler convention heavily publicized permanent advertisements meeting time place future time travelers meet . , group baltimore , maryland , identifying krononauts , hosted event type welcoming visitors future . experiments stood possibility generating positive result demonstrating existence time travel , failed farno time travelers known attended either event . versions manyworlds interpretation used suggest future humans traveled back time , traveled back meeting time place parallel universe . time dilation main article time dilation transversal time dilation . blue dots represent pulse light . pair dots light bouncing clock . group clocks , group appears ticking slowly , moving clocks light pulse travel larger distance stationary clocks light pulse . , even though clocks identical relative motion perfectly reciprocal . great deal observable evidence time dilation special relativity71 gravitational time dilation general relativity , example famous easytoreplicate observation atmospheric muon decay . theory relativity states speed light invariant observers frame reference , always . time dilation direct consequence invariance speed light . time dilation may regarded limited sense time travel future person may use time dilation small amount proper time passes , large amount proper time passes elsewhere . achieved traveling relativistic speeds effects gravity . two identical clocks moving relative without accelerating , clock measures ticking slower . possible due relativity simultaneity . however , symmetry broken one clock accelerates , allowing less proper time pass one clock . twin paradox describes one twin remains earth , undergoes acceleration relativistic speed travel space , turn around , travel back earth traveling twin ages less twin stayed earth , time dilation experienced acceleration . general relativity treats effects acceleration effects gravity equivalent , shows time dilation also occurs gravity wells , clock deeper well ticking slowly effect taken account calibrating clocks satellites global positioning system , could lead significant differences rates aging observers different distances large gravity well black hole . time machine utilizes principle might , instance , spherical shell diameter five meters mass jupiter . person center travel forward time rate four times slower distant observers . squeezing mass large planet small structure expected within humanitys technological capabilities near future . current technologies , possible cause human traveler age less companions earth milliseconds hundred days space travel . philosophy main article philosophy space time philosophers discussed philosophy space time since least time ancient greece example , parmenides presented view time illusion . centuries later , isaac newton supported idea absolute time , contemporary gottfried wilhelm leibniz maintained time relation events expressed independently . latter approach eventually gave rise spacetime relativity . presentism vs. eternalism many philosophers argued relativity implies eternalism , idea past future exist real sense , changes occurred occur present . philosopher science dean rickles disagrees qualifications , notes consensus among philosophers seems special general relativity incompatible presentism . philosophers view time dimension equal spatial dimensions , future events already sense different places exist , objective flow time however , view disputed . bar ring paradox example relativity simultaneity . ends bar pass ring simultaneously rest frame ring left , ends bar pass one rest frame bar right . presentism school philosophy holds future past exist changes occurred occur present , real existence . view , time travel impossible future past travel . keller nelson argued even past future objects exist , still definite truths past future events , thus possible future truth time traveler deciding travel back present date could explain time travelers actual appearance present84 views contested authors . presentism classical spacetime deems present exists reconcilable special relativity , shown following example alice bob simultaneous observers event o. alice , event e simultaneous , bob , event e past future . therefore , alice bob disagree exists present , contradicts classical presentism . herenow presentism attempts reconcile acknowledging time space single point unsatisfactory objects coming going herenow alternate real unreal , addition lack privileged herenow would real present . relativized presentism acknowledges infinite frames reference , different set simultaneous events , makes impossible distinguish single real present , hence either events time realblurring difference presentism eternalismor frame reference exists reality . options presentism special relativity appear exhausted , gdel others suspect presentism may valid forms general relativity . generally , idea absolute time space considered incompatible general relativity universal truth absolute position events occur different times , thus way determine point space one time universal position another time , coordinate systems equal footing given principle diffeomorphism invariance . grandfather paradox main article grandfather paradox common objection idea traveling back time put forth grandfather paradox argument autoinfanticide . one able go back time , inconsistencies contradictions would ensue time traveler change anything contradiction past becomes different way . paradox commonly described person travels past kills grandfather , prevents existence father mother , therefore existence . philosophers question whether paradoxes prove time travel impossible . philosophers answer paradoxes arguing might case backward time travel could possible would impossible actually change past way , idea similar proposed novikov selfconsistency principle physics . ontological paradox compossibility according philosophical theory compossibility , happen , example context time travel , must weighed context everything relating situation . past certain way , possible way . happen time traveler visits past limited happen , order prevent logical contradictions . selfconsistency principle novikov selfconsistency principle , named igor dmitrievich novikov , states actions taken time traveler object travels back time part history along , therefore impossible time traveler change history way . time travelers actions may cause events past though , leads potential circular causation , sometimes called predestination paradox , ontological paradox , bootstrap paradox . term bootstrap paradox popularized robert a. heinleins story bootstraps . novikov selfconsistency principle proposes local laws physics region spacetime containing time travelers different local laws physics region spacetime . philosopher kelley l. ross argues time travel paradoxes99 scenario involving physical object whose worldline history forms closed loop time violation second law thermodynamics . ross uses film somewhere time example ontological paradox , watch given person , years later watch brought back time given character . ross states entropy watch increase , watch carried back time worn repetition history . second law thermodynamics understood modern physicists statistical law , decreasing entropy nonincreasing entropy impossible , improbable . additionally , entropy statistically increases systems isolated , nonisolated systems , object , interact outside world , become less worn decrease entropy , possible object whose worldline forms closed loop always condition point history . , daniel greenberger karl svozil proposed quantum theory gives model time travel past must selfconsistent . see also claims time travel time travel claims urban legends parapsychology culture time capsule fiction time travel fiction list time travel works fiction time viewer meetings time
