populations predator prey food chain , often results dramatic changes ecosystem structure nutrient cycling.what trophic cascade ? learn small changes food pyramid upend ecosystem.moresee videos articlein threelevel food chain , increase decrease carnivores causes decrease increase herbivores increase decrease primary producers plants phytoplankton . example , eastern north america removal wolves canis lupus associated increase whitetailed deer odocoileus virginianus decline plants eaten deer . american zoologist robert paine coined term trophic cascade describe reciprocal changes food webs caused experimental manipulations top predators . 1980s others used term describe changes aquatic ecosystems arising factors sudden increases predatory fish populations stocking dramatic declines predatory fishes caused overfishing . effects aquatic terrestrial ecosystems trophic pyramidtrophic pyramid , also called energy pyramid , showing progression food energy . pyramid base contains producers , organisms make food inorganic substances . organisms pyramid consumers . consumers level feed organisms level consumed organisms level . food energy enters trophic level lost heat used organisms power normal activities life . thus , higher trophic level pyramid , lower amount available energy.moreduring 1980s 90s series experiments demonstrated trophic cascades adding removing top carnivores , bass micropterus yellow perch perca flavescens , freshwater lakes . experiments showed trophic cascades controlled biomass production phytoplankton , recycling rates nutrients , ratio nitrogen phosphorus available phytoplankton , activity bacteria , sedimentation rates . trophic cascades affected rates primary production respiration lake whole , affected rates exchange carbon dioxide oxygen lake atmosphere . sea ottera sea otter enhydra lutris feeding sea urchin kachemak bay national estuarine research reserve alaska.moreresearch wide variety terrestrial aquatic environments shown trophic cascades control species composition , biomass , production herbivores plants . example , overfishing cod gadus morhua commercially exploited fishes haddock melanogrammus hake urophycis , raniceps , phycis north atlantic ocean led increase small pelagic open ocean fish consumed cod , snow crab chionoecetes opilio , shrimp . result , populations largebodied herbivorous zooplankton , consumed small pelagic fishes , decreased , turn led increase phytoplankton . restoration wolves bow valley alberta , canada , decreased population elk cervus elaphus increased growth aspen populus willow salix . another example , commercial harvesting sea otters enhydra lutris fur trade west coast north america triggered increase sea urchins decline kelp forests , kelp consumption urchins , nearby marine environments . traditionally , plant production nutrient cycling thought controlled physical chemical factors , solar radiation , climate , nutrient supply . physical chemical factors important , producer communities metabolic rates also influenced trophic cascades . ecosystems without top predators trophic cascadetrophic cascade scenario removal top carnivores terrestrial ecosystem.morein many instances , trophic cascades initiated human persecution harvesting top carnivores , wolves big cats terrestrial ecosystems sharks , tunas , game fish aquatic ecosystems . removal top carnivores triggers significant effects prey populations , primary producers , ecosystem processes . therefore , conservation top carnivores helps preserve structure processes ecosystems

mesopredator release , phenomenon populations mediumsized predators rapidly increase play greater roles ecosystems inhabit , caused removal top carnivores . mesopredators compete poorly may consumed top carnivores thus tend avoid . systematic decline cougars puma concolor wolves conterminous united states parts north america 20th century allowed populations mesopredators coyotes canis latrans , red foxes vulpes vulpes , raccoons procyon lotor increase , food sources , hunting grounds , den sites , resources controlled top carnivores became available . decline leopards panthera pardus parts africa allowed baboon papio populations increase . loss large sharks oceans allowed smallerbodied sharks rays increase . case , mesopredator release caused decline species consumed mesopredator . addition , mesopredators become nuisance species . foraging raccoons plunder trash cans gardens many urban areas noted carriers rabies virus . baboons invade homes , break cars steal food , cases pose threat children . biomanipulation lakes lakes , trophic cascades used improve water quality biomanipulation , management practice humans intentionally remove whole species ecosystems . goal biomanipulation reduce concentration harmful phytoplankton , toxic bluegreen algae . direct method control harmful phytoplankton blooms reduce inputs nutrients phosphorus drive growth . cases arrival nutrients ecosystem delayed slow develop , biomanipulation used hasten decline harmful phytoplankton . stocking game fish protection harvest using special regulations triggers trophic cascade decreases biomass smallerbodied fish , increases biomass herbivorous zooplankton , decreases biomass harmful phytoplankton . cases planktoneating fish removed directly lake managers . addition , removal bottomfeeding fish shallow lakes leads increases rooted vegetation increased water clarity rooted plants stabilize sediments . transition involves trophic cascade , herbivorous zooplankton increase biomass consume phytoplankton , also involves direct effects rooted vegetation sediment stability nutrient cycling . stephen carpenter
