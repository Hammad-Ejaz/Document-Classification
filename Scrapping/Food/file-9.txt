nevertheless , , history food korean peninsula mainly studied history scholars read chinese characters rather natural scientists , resulting errors distortions understanding identity , history ,

researching health functionalities cultural values korean food develop global food worldwide . introductionthe global popularity k-pop music korean movies dramas increased worldwide interest korean culture whole . expanded interest korean culture also increased awareness interest korean ethnic foods ( k-foods ) since integral component korean lifestyle culture . however , full understanding k-foods requires appreciation historical spiritual values inspired development well comprehension geographical geological characteristics korean peninsula influenced food culture developed transition hunters gatherers largely agrarian society . unfortunately , little research available reliably describe historical , geographical , cultural value traditional korean foods . korean food sometimes viewed context ancient chinese documents , including classical literature whole , unique regional food . result , profound misunderstanding identity , historicity , originality k-food [ , ] .evaluations food composition preparation methods reveal korean food ( k-food ) unique compared ethnic foods . kimchi jang ( fermented soybean sauce paste , kanjang , doenjang , kochujang ) fermented foods unique korea . although korean food components cabbages , rice , soy , fish common throughout asia , early korean population developed characteristic foods relative isolation regions asia due oceans rugged mountains surrounding country . therefore , must careful discussing culture history korean food chinese books even books written chinese characters published korea . particular , books written chinese characters men korea mothers grandmothers learned practical use making food , many books written referring chinese books contain contents based chinese food . nevertheless , since korea discriminatory nation terms food , culture language china , someone learned difficult chinese characters talks korean food , tend believed truth without scientific examination become established concept fixed concept . reason , numerous mistakes distortions k-food accepted factual ordinary citizens . common distortion error explaining history kimchi korea variant chinese dish `` paochayi ( 泡菜 ) , '' thus reducing history kimchi hundreds years less [ , , ] . misconception repeatedly spread popular media , causing considered factual poorly informed population . addition , chinese western sinocentrism eurocentrism scholars assert china europe cultural economic epicenters culture trade spread parts world . viewpoint led belief original name `` dakdoritang , '' traditional korean food deep-rooted cultural history hundreds years , called `` dakbokkeumtang ( distorted name ) '' despite lack evidence originated japan [ ] .many scholars , especially hanja ( ancient korean writing using chinese characters ) , argued development korean food due wars , exchanges , documents , imitations countries , resulting development ethnic food . however , mentioned , korea historically geographically isolated , even stone age . furthermore , also historically resistant outside influences interactions commonly called `` hermit kingdom . '' although ethnic foods partially result mutual interactions outside influences , greater influence availability regional foods wild plants animals , natural materials used manufacture utensils , conditions affect food storage methods . example , tropical jungles , many wild plants herbs developed seasonings preserve foods , fermented foods difficult develop . grasslands herbivorous animals raised , meat dairy products became common foods , products smoked meats , cheese , fermented foods became staples . regions wheat major food crop , preserved characteristics wheat dishes directly putting salt wheat flour keep texture taste , thereby developing various forms single dish . main reason salt added directly wheat flour making bread noodles help form gluten dough functionality elasticity extensibility addition taste . regions cultivate rice main ingredient , like china , southeast asia , korea , developed rice staple food . unlike nations wheat staple food , directly put salt rice ; korea , salt added enhance taste tteok ( korean rice cakes ) .china long history using lard ( oil swine ) fish oil food preparation . cooking temperature oil high ( – °c ) , many aromatic substances produced , enhances flavor [ ] . chinese food called `` flavorful taste fire . '' furthermore , water vaporizes °c , foods prepared high temperatures low moisture activity , improving storage time . therefore , oil extraction common first step butchering pigs processing pepper seeds china . contrast , korea , blood first drained butchering pigs , powder made peppers , oil never extracted . differences processing fundamental differences korean chinese food processing greatly influences final products.another distinctive feature korean cuisine unique presentation bap ( boiled rice ) banchan ( side dishes ) [ ] ( fig . ) . , ethnic cuisines focus `` eat ? , '' korean cuisine culture `` eat bap ? . '' korean ancestors always pondered bap deliciously main staple grain enhance taste ( mat , 맛 ) adding condiments plants collected fields mountains [ , ] . call banchan culture , food culture exist country world . usually , scoop spoon bap spoon , put mouth , pick one banchans chopsticks eat . sometimes , scoop kuk ( looks like soup ) spoon kuk helps bap go throat well . kuk carefully cooked maximize flavor taste eaten spoonful bap spoonful kuk . however , westerners sometimes n't understand kuk culture mistakenly think kuk eaten bap , like soup . thus kuk tasty . make , adjust kan salt jang make feel good comfortable . called delicious state kuk 'kan right ' [ ] taste 'siwonhan-mat ' [ ] . however , scholars korea say kuk salty even though kuk accompanying food bap deliciously , calorie intake , without distinguishing kuk western soup [ ] . different ethnic root china , also oil sugar elements make food delicious agriculturally.fig . 1typical structure traditional korean bap-sang ( see fig . . reference ) . bap ( boiled rice ) served alongside kuk bowl , assists swallowing digestion food . bap-sang , banchan comprised one type kimchi , one namul , one vegetable dish ( banchan ) , one high protein dish ( banchan ii ) , usually made fish meat chim ( 찜 ) gui ( 구이 ) . jang , salted dishes jangat-ji jeotgal , used season food stimulate one ’ appetite . variety bap-sang constructed using diverse ingredients cooking methods depending season , region , one 's preference . overlapping ingredients methods allow well-balanced flavors nutrientsfull size imagethe manchurian region , including korean peninsula , tropical area fruits bananas abundant . extensive flatlands plains grains planted main crops , livestock farming possible . however , due geographical conditions many grasses herbs growing mountains fields fish seaweed harvested sea . result geographical constraints , ancient koreans find way make delicious banchan meals ingredients . reason , fermented foods korea , kimchi jang , developed condiments make banchans tasty , rather relying solely dishes . vegetables herbs , less flavor contain salt , fat , protein . essence korean cuisine lies spirit wisdom korean ancestors eat tasteless vegetables deliciously , said soul korean food.in paper , discuss origin development process traditional korean food various historical geographical difficulties perspective korean origin , migration , settlement , agronomical food science backgrounds , well scientific cultural backgrounds sustainable growth lead healthy korean food.world ethnic food generation direction developmentas mentioned korean jang 's paper special issue [ ] , ethnic groups develop general direction resolve three fundamental food issues common mankind ( fig . ) . first , survive lives eating foodstuffs without getting sick dying ? therefore , investigate develop foodstuffs safely satisfy hunger . second , eat deliciously ? humanity 's first survival task eat safely , solved , want eat deliciously . gourmets ' concern eat foods deliciously human instinct passed ancient times present . third , safely eat leftovers later ? foodstuff always available . particular , foods short shelf life , rice , hunted meat , fruits , vegetables , rapidly spoiled microorganisms . thus , easy save even little bit next time . region nation world develops food confronting concerns , food development process solving three concerns . time , food made according conditions environment region , region characteristics , ethnic food ( fig . ) .fig . 2the development direction world ethnic foods . first , survive lives eating foodstuffs without getting sick dying ? second , eat deliciously ? third , safely eat leftovers later ? region nation world develops food going concerns , food development process solving three concernsfull size imagethe discovery fire , invention earthenware , ethnic foodsthe discovery fire paleolithic era solved first problems food safety also solved second tasks improving taste : enjoy meal without upset stomach . eating uncooked rice , beans , vegetables , meat cause stomach upset sometimes life-threatening . cooking fire made safe eat , taste also improved . heating boiling foods fire sterilizes microorganisms , making food intake safer . addition , protein denatured heat , taste improves , digestion absorption improved facilitating action digestive enzymes.upon discovery fire , people korean peninsula able store grains , cook food , ferment food using earthenware vessels [ ] . earthenware vessels found korea ancient times primitive patternless pottery , mostly different china . alone , tell food culture ancient times korea independently formed china . case , discovery fire earthenware vessels , became possible cook food , store grains , ferment food condiments kimchi , aided earthenware vessels ( see fig . . ref ) . earthenware vessels developed due discovery fire called dok ( hangari , earthenware jars ) onggi ( chinese character ) used storing kimchi jang ferment properly . kind earthenware vessel porous structure , making highly permeable allowing water allowing gases co2 escape fermentation . korean ancestors understood phenomenon `` taking breath . '' time , pressure fluids also prevented contamination putrefactive microbes [ ] .discovery iron korean culturethe korean chinese peoples ethnologically different nations . however , field research studying korean food culture committed mistake attempting find roots korean food culture chinese cuisine , even korean.korea culture agriculture lasted five thousand years . geographically , adjacent china , uniquely continued develop independently thereby developing preserving culture history without culturally absorbed country china . human species ( homo sapiens ) , originating africa , split many branches ; one settled china korean peninsula passing eurasian continent via amur river . today , development dna analysis technology , whole genome ancient humans analyzed , serves confirmation [ , ] . today 's chinese ethnic groups diverse , chinese ethnic group represented han ( 漢 ) people set foundation country establishing yellow river culture ( 黃河文化 ) yellow river center . hand , korean ancestors founded gojoseon dynasty rooted history culture liaohe culture ( 遼河文化 ) , based manchuria ( consisting parts china 's liaoning province , heilongjiang province , jilin province , inner mongolia autonomous region ) [ , ] . means roots korea clearly different china . careful study history three kingdoms period , represented gokuryeo , baekje , silla , history goryeo joseon reveals korea survived inheriting maintaining unique culture distinct china 's . also true food culture.liaohe culture displays totally different characteristics biologically , archaeologically , linguistically , culturally yellow river culture . representative unique artifacts relics korean liaohe culture mumun pottery ( patternless pottery ) ondol ( floor heating system ) . terms language , korean classified ural-altaic ( trans-eurasian ) , completely different chinese language system ( india-europe ) [ , ] . korean belongs linguistic family manchurian ( ancient gokuryeo ) , mongolian , japanese , hungarian , finnish . koreans also mongolian spots , like mongolians . thus , korea developed differently geographically , ethnically , culturally china . way , korean food culture also distinct characteristics different chinese food culture ; autonomous unique . despite , many people study korean food culture still misunderstand originating chinese yellow river culture . mistakes misconceptions happen ? written language characters developed early yellow river culture , chinese characters ( 漢字 ) created , allowing records kept since antiquity . records , history culture time understood . hand , liaohe culture culture characters developed . therefore , understand liaohe culture , necessary infer geography , history , language , cultural life relics artifacts rather written records . however , task easy korea . conversely , easy tell history culture korean cuisine simply referring chinese literature chinese characters ' literature without scientific examination . result , many distortions errors developing korean cuisine.many people claim humans progressed bronze age iron age , development transportation chariots development tools knives , spears , axes , bows , wars frequent , exchanges active , thus contributing changes ethnic foods . however , looking modern science human genome analysis ethnic groups , possible see progress foods languages little possibility claims introduction theory imitation theory countries , development theory , etc . conserved foods developed concerted efforts.after paleolithic age neolithic age , weapons means transportation began develop bronze age iron age . made scale war larger allowed casualties . fact , genome analysis using ancient dna reveals female genetic diversity ( x-chromosome ) population size continued increase time , male genetic diversity ( y-chromosome ) showed many inflection points [ see fig . ref ] . also point genetic diversity population size males decline rapidly , corresponding bronze/iron age around years ago [ ] . rapid decline male genetic diversity population size occur without male genocide . meanwhile , female population steadily increased period . addition , genetic analysis ancient people revealed korean people , considered single race single lineage , gradually genetically mixed [ ] . totality results suggests war , invaders slaughtered men humiliated women.due war , almost none men survived , women suffered maltreatment , yet ethnic mix greatly change language food culture , passed thousands years unique language food . korean language food culture different neighboring china . koreans spoke trans-eurasian language ( ural-altaic ) used little oil cooking . vavilov 's results came [ ] , korea 's unique culture language believed passed bloodlines [ ] . right least far back paleolithic neolithic periods farming hunting began . however , considering results ancient genome analysis mentioned , korean people become genetically diverse extent called single lineage due numerous wars foreign invasions , language , culture , food preserved level single ethnic group , completely different china . seen culture , language , food preserved even though men died women humiliated due numerous wars invasions tribes . many cases , bronze/iron age , invaders would killed husbands left young sons . however , would woman 's responsibility give birth , raise , save even children invaders . therefore , believed uniqueness food , culture , language maintained centering women , even though culture language may passed bloodline stone age [ ] . massacre men meant food supply remaining women children sparse , given men primarily responsible hunting , farming , providing food families.therefore , false claim korean food came either china japan men 's communication . wars advanced development food . contrary , wars bring oppressive dark age food development . mothers ' languages changed war , food would changed either . ethnic foods originate naturally nation 's unique characteristics geohistorical background ; true searching truth.how koreans eat something delicious ? discovery use fire pottery ushered new era food safety . although progress food safety earlier times , problem food scarcity remained unsolved remained dilemma . furthermore , natural disasters wars continued cause shortages food resources . famine conditions require people eat mostly indigestible plants , grasses trees , well insects unusual sea creatures , survive . generally , meat milk animals relatively flavorful . however , grass tree shoots usually tasteless , rough , crude , people want eat unless short food . even food shortage problem solved , eating grains rice bland satisfying nutritionally balanced . therefore , making side dishes improve flavor nutritional content necessary . reason , korean ancestors , especially women , find ways make hard-to-eat plant animal foods palatable could survive starvation . entrusted making edible delicious possible , korean food culture may developed process resolving concerns.the effort make food delicious major task developing food core food culture . environment livestock dairy products exist , sugar provide sweet taste unavailable , oil enhance flavor , ancient koreans developed side dishes add flavor boiled rice . core k-foods , combining side dishes boiled rice called banchan bap , respectively . preparation flavorful banchan vegetables , without sugar oil , central development k-foods . although foods countries developed result efforts make staple foods delicious , koreans make highly flavorful banchan accompany staple food , bap , make flavorful delicious eat [ , ] . result , diversity korean foods linked diversity banchans . use banchans augment rice analogous eating foods bread wheat flour western countries . however , develop various kinds banchans using local ingredients , cooking methods , flavorings . fact , thousands kinds banchans korean food [ , ] . thus , korean cuisine provides diverse selection food ingredients greater variety flavors cuisine worldwide . koreans make ingredients cuisine world delicious dishes various ways . even things western people discard thinking make palatable , made delicious using korean banchan dishes . reason , usa china , chicken dishes simply fried , korea , make various kinds seasoned fried chicken yangnyom [ ] , explains worldwide popularity korean chicken.taste ( mat ) koreakorean foods distinct taste western cuisine . generally , taste western cuisine detected tongue . tastes western cuisine mainly sweet , salty , sour , umami , bitter . therefore , started search ingredients bring tastes , beginning adding salt dough ending sprinkling salt foods table . method exploring flavors tastes western cuisine led long arduous journey looking spices brought certain flavors middle ages . impetus behind columbus ’ voyage discovery exploration indies . starting central america , westerners contributed large part food taste history . people like sweet tastes , mainly found sugar west . korea , sugar also used achieve sweet tastes , rare occasions , produced honey bees , sometimes people make syrup called jocheong using hydrolyzed starch special occasions seol ( lunar new year 's day ) . since discovery sugarcane south central america seventeenth century , discovery materials produce sweet taste allowed large-scale cultivation sugarcane . since nineteenth century , sugar also produced large quantities . way , westerners developed taste preferences based single flavors centered around salt , pepper , sugar , complementary foods utilized developed.in contrast western pursuit single taste searching ingredients , koreans seek bring tasty flavors banchan ; , eat bap . westerners often select certain meat parts discard remaining animal parts , korean ancestors reluctant discard innards animals extracted essence even bone used aqueous source ( broth kuk , kuk-mul ) . early koreans mostly ate plants encountered many cases difficulty making palatable tastes certain plants ; referred 'japnae ( miscellaneous off-flavor ) ' korea . priority koreans remove difficult-to-overcome japnae eat things difficult eat , vegetables , accentuating tasty mat ( tastes flavors ) liked—this development history korean food tastes . fact , relatively easy remove japnae bring taste cooking high temperature sugar oil . however , understand korean ancestors able find way make food flavorful absence sugar oil farming perspective , easier us understand korean food . kan , yangnyom , kukmul ( broth kuk ) westerners mask off-flavor vegetables meats adding sugar making food flavorful . remove japnae ( miscellaneous off-flavor ) , korean ancestors used variety herbs ingredients , added doenjang ( fermented soy paste ) , kanjang ( fermented soy sauce ) , vinegar boiling broth , soaked together make mat kanjang doenjang permeate food . result , korean food delicious . eating kuk banchan needs permeated mouth delicious . salt , east west , used basic ingredient played important role delicious . taste low salty taste , people say , 'kan right ( 's watery tasteless ) ' ; taste really savory , say , 'kan right ( seasoning right delicious ) , ' taste salty , like brine cooking long time lot salt seasoning , also say 'kan right ( seasoning right salty ) ' [ , ] .contrarily , simmering meat long time special ingredients extract tasty elements kuk-mul ( broth kuk ) , thus making kuk tastier . koreans usually enjoy kuk sipping eating spoonfuls eat bap . way consumption led korean culinary culture referred “ kuk-mul culture ” . time , said kan seasoned properly , tasteless , kuk well-seasoned ingredients salt meat flavors , kuk tasty proper kan. korean kuk-mul culture , people talk taste kuk , prioritize whether kan adequately seasoned , also appreciate “ siwonhan-mat ( refreshing comfortable taste korean ) ” makes person feel good inside ( english equivalent would feel warm inside ) drinking well-made kuk [ , ] . refreshing taste usually perceived taste buds visceral sensation . said contrast mixtures various tastes indistinguishable tastes , well-made kuk unique distinct taste described “ refreshing ” . koreans say taste kuk `` refreshing '' salty taste matches flavor bap , comfortably filling , one 's mood improved . may salt content kuk almost amount sodium human bodies ( . % ) , said `` kan correct . '' person well-made kuk , body positive response appropriate salt concentration . person feels refreshed , food easily digested , one 's mood elevated . mood-enhancing properties kuk koreans consider delicious taste.animals minerals like sodium , boiled , fermented , roasted , taste due interaction minerals amino acids peptides produced . however , vegetables minerals like salt , bland little flavor . phytochemicals exist spices plants often bitter , spicy , pungent substances protect plants directly eaten foraging animals . thus , easy eat many vegetables grass directly . korean food overcome difficulty making vegetables tasty , skill passed today 's korean food . order reduce toxins often associated bland bitter taste , boiling vegetables water usually reduce quantity . difficult maintain texture vegetables , necessary find way maintain unique texture also make soft enough eat.to eliminate japnae present appetizing color , korea developed used unique sauce called 'yangnyom ' food systems [ , ] . yangnyom , uniquely korean key ingredient making ingredients tastier , prepared chopping garlic , chili peppers ( chili peppers grown korea manchuria called kochu ) , leek ( green onions ) , gingers , adding sesame oil , sesame seeds , kochu powder , kanjang , salt . color important yangnyom ; yangnyom combinations made kochu powder ( dried red chili , capsicum annuum powder ) kochujang ( fermented kochu powder paste ) , appetizing food color red . chili peppers long history korean food used make red stimulate appetite [ , ] . vegetables cut seasoned yangnyom hand make tasty . provides good taste vegetables soft textures seasoned yangnyom directly . however , vegetables hard textures first blanched salted seasoned yangnyom hands , soft texture taste . taste korean food 'taste mother 's hands ' . vegetables boiled – °c yangnyom eaten , become namul [ , ] . vegetables pickled salt hypertonic conditions remove juice cell , including sodium ions , change texture vegetables prevent growth pathogenic microorganisms due osmotic pressure . pickled cabbage seasoned yangnyom , called geotjeoli , fermentation [ , ] . cabbage yangnyom go rancid fermentation due inability grow majority bacteria except lactic acid bacteria.the characteristic taste korean food one derived single ingredient rather unique taste expressed combination kuk-mul , yangnyom , ingredients create harmonious taste adjusted kan. korean taste creates entirely new mat ( flavor ) blending together different ingredients , commonly referred `` kipeun-mat ( deep flavor ) '' unique amalgam . way , korean cuisine developed create hundreds tastes ( mats ) based sense taste , thus creating expressions tastes . country world expresses hundred mat [ ] .agronomic background : origins rice , beans , peppers , chinese cabbagekorean food developed due numerous efforts make safe delicious based agricultural products korean peninsula manchuria . agriculturally , development region ethnic group 's cuisine depends kind food ingredients grow naturally area . available edible resources vary according natural environment humans live . words , biological resources obtained surroundings different depending geographical environment climatic conditions , beaches , land , plains , mountains . millet rice plants present korean soil , people would thought eating bap thousands years , beans present korean land , jang fermentation would developed . thanks unique korean chilies ( kochu , korean chili capsicum annuum , different variety commonly used south central america southern asia today , brutally hot ) , could make kochugaru ( chili powder ) yangnyom kochujang . baechu ( napa cabbage ) variety n't grown manchuria korea , would considered making kimchi . fundamental philosophy behind birth korean ethnic foods : could manage eat locally available produce make delicious hundreds years intentional efforts ( fig . ) .despite , food science researchers abandoned basic philosophy food development claimed korean food introduced outside trusting wrong documents reducing history kimchi kochujang less several hundred years [ , , ] . order rationalize institutionalize claims , eventually distort biological , agronomic , geographic , environmental history kochu , baechu , soybeans grown korean peninsula . distortions korean history minimize importance ancient cultivation history rice , kochu , baechu , soybeans grown korean peninsula.rice plant ( byeo narak ) tens millions years ago , rice first appeared earth , growing wild diverging short-grain rice , japonica type , long-grain rice , indica type , million years ago evolution . highly likely humans mainly spread rice since animals would unlikely spread seeds easily digested intestines . though possible wind spread rice humans appeared earth , possibility spread widely country-by-country continent-by-continent limited , likely spread widely response human needs . words , history spread rice similar history cultivation.it conjectured rice cultivation began least , years ago . previously , thought rice cultivation originated assam region india , spreading myanmar , thailand , laos , yunnan , china [ ] . however , many believe rice cultivation began hunan , rice grains found china 's yangtze river [ ] . seen rice found songori , chungju , korea , , years ago [ ] . however , yet discovered exactly rice koreans eat first cultivated spread korea . also certain whether short-grain rice ( oryza sativa coreaca ) spread short-grain rice long-grain rice spread , japonica type ( short-grain ) chosen passed . nevertheless , southern regions near yangtze river generally dominated long-grain indica-type rice , whereas northern regions grow short-grain japonica-type rice . highly likely two types rice spread together , one chosen cultivation paleolithic neolithic periods based preference eat . therefore , even though rice staple across many countries thousands years , unique ethnic foods.soybeanssoybeans existed millions years humans appeared earth . however , soybean species grows specific area soybeans transplanted without human intervention . soy seeds food birds like , eat , get digested bellies . fly far , ca n't spread seeds . certain areas origin wild varieties pulses ( beans ) humans first discovered . fact , various kinds pulses earth , soybeans ( glycine spp ) manchuria , lentils india , chickpeas egypt , mesopotamian beans . analyzing genome , estimated soybeans growing earth , particularly korean peninsula , ten million years humans started cultivating one million years ago [ , , , ] . nevertheless , since pulses grains eating raw may cause food poisoning due presence trypsin inhibitors , widely spread . , years ago bean products , primitive cheongkukjang , introduced china [ , ] .tracing origin rarely propagated crops accomplished biological analysis based documentary analysis since long ago [ , ] . biological approach , distribution wild species used essential indicator deducing birthplace crops botany [ ] . academia defines place wild , intermediate , cultivated soybeans grow one place plant 's

korea china appears chinese documents ( 張華 , 博物誌 ( bakmulji ) , bc – ) [ ] . , however , incorrect claim since made without sufficiently reading ancient texts understanding agricultural background behind [ ] .kochu ( chili pepper , chili ) chili peppers members capsicum genus belong eggplant family ( solanaceae ) , evolved capsicum solanacea eggplants tomatoes etc . . million years [ ] . widely believed capsicum species tropical plants native equatorial regions north south america christopher columbus brought west end fifteenth century [ , , ] . however , belief largely erroneous modern scientific perspectives : correct central america native place chili peppers varieties , true columbus brought chili peppers west , asian pepper chilies . chili pepper species , naga jolokia asia , especially india , found latin america , means naga jolokia could originated latin america . indian chili species.the belief persisted largely due fact chili peppers brought west central america time columbus , without good understanding diversity evolutionary process chili pepper varieties , well culinary agricultural characteristics [ ] . belief based chili pepper originated equatorial regions
