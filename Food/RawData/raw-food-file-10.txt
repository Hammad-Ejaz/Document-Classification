Zero HungerZero hunger is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations in 2015. It aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture worldwide by 2030.














What is Zero Hunger?Zero Hunger is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is defined as the objective to ensure that everyone has access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and preferences, and that all people have the ability to acquire the food they need, without compromising their economic, social, and environmental well-being.Although there is more than enough food produced today to feed many people, there are up to 828 million people that remain chronically undernourished. Malnutrition is taking a heavy toll across developing and developed nations. There are more than two billion adults, adolescents, and children who are now obese or overweight. These concerning trends coincide with the diminishing availability of land; increasing soil and biodiversity degradation, and more frequent and severe weather events. 

 



  Definition of Zero Hunger
    


 Zero hunger aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture and food systems. 
    















Zero Hunger Initiatives

 





School Feeding ProgramsIn many countries, school feeding programs provide children with nutritious meals during the school day, which can improve their health and academic performance. School feeding programs help address malnutrition, increases food security, encourages school enrollment, and supports local food production.







Food Security PoliciesGovernments can implement policies and legislation that promote food security and improve access to nutritious food, such as subsidies for small farmers and food assistance programs for vulnerable populations. Food security policies and legislation addresses food availability, improves access to food, promotes food safety, and builds resilience.







Food Banks & Food Rescue ProgramsThese initiatives collect surplus food from supermarkets, restaurants, and other sources and distribute it to people in need. These programs help to reduce food waste, improve food access, support vulnerable populations, and provide emergency relief when needed. 

 












Why Zero Hunger is Important

 

Improved HealthWhen people have access to sufficient, nutritious food, their health improves, and they are less likely to suffer from malnutrition, stunted growth, or chronic diseases.



Reduced PovertyHunger often affects those living in poverty the most. By addressing food insecurity, zero hunger initiatives can help lift people out of poverty and create more equitable societies.



Environmental SustainabilityZero hunger initiatives can help promote sustainable agriculture practices that protect the environment, preserve natural resources, and mitigate climate change.

 
















Zero Hunger Statistics

 

720 million to 811 million persons suffer from hunger.According to the United Nations Sustainable Goals, in 2020, between 720 million and 811 million persons worldwide were suffering from hunger, roughly 161 million more than in 2019.



Over 41 million people are at risk of famine.According to a report by the World Food Programme, over 41 million people in 43 countries are at risk of famine due to conflict, climate change, and economic shocks. This represents a 28% increase compared to 2020.



1 in 7 Americans experienced food insecurityAccording CNBC, in the United States, food insecurity rates remain high, with an estimated 38 million people, including 12 million children, experiencing food insecurity in 2021, according to a report by Feeding America. This represents an increase of 8.9 million people since 2019.

 
















Zero Hunger in the News

 

Conflict in YemenIn December 2022, the World Food Program (WFP)World Food Programme (WFP) warned that the crisis in Yemen, which has been fueled by conflict and economic collapse, could lead to famine in 2023, affecting millions of people. Despite ongoing humanitarian assistance, up to 19 million Yemenis are food insecure. 

 

AgroecologyIn November 2022, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) launched a new initiative called “Agroecology for Zero Hunger” aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture practices that protect the environment, preserve natural resources, and reduce poverty. Agroecology has the potential to advance the transition to sustainable food systems and contribute to the restoration of ecosystems.

 

MalnutritionIn October 2022, a new study published in The Lancet highlighted the importance of addressing the double burden of malnutrition, which includes both undernutrition and overweight/obesity, in order to achieve Zero Hunger and improve global health.
