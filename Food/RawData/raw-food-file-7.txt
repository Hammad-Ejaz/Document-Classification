Welcome to The Food Studio: Where Food, Music and Culture, Converge!
At The Food Studio, we are pioneering a revolutionary concept: A 100% community-based, plant-based, shared commercial kitchen incubator and accelerator. Located in the vibrant heart of Pittsburgh Yards Development in South Atlanta, we're not just a kitchen; we're a movement, a catalyst for change, and a beacon of hope for aspiring food entrepreneurs.
The Food Studio is not just a kitchen—it's a game-changer. As the nation's first 100% community-based, plant-based, shared commercial kitchen incubator and accelerator, we're redefining the way we think about food, business, and community in South Atlanta's Pittsburgh Yards Development.
 
Cultural Connection:
The Food Studio celebrates the rich cultural heritage of Africans and African Americans across the diaspora, recognizing food and music as integral components of this heritage. Our space is more than just a kitchen; it's a melting pot of flavors, rhythms, and stories waiting to be shared.
Focus on Health:
Health is at the heart of everything we do. Our commitment to plant-based nutrition isn't just about trendy diets—it's about creating a healthier, more vibrant community. By integrating infrastructure and entrepreneurial support, we empower food entrepreneurs to create businesses that not only thrive economically but also contribute to the well-being of our community.
Our Mission:
We are on a mission to empower local plant-based food entrepreneurs and hospitality businesses by providing them with the space, resources, and support they need to thrive. But our mission goes beyond just business success; we're committed to improving economic conditions and enhancing well-being within our community through access to healthier foods and entrepreneurial opportunities.
Our Vision:
At The Food Studio, we envision a future where everyone has access to healthier, more sustainable food options. Our mission is twofold: to support local plant-based food entrepreneurs and hospitality businesses in need of production space, and to improve the health and well-being of our community through access to nutritious, delicious meals

the power of plant-based






Plant-based diets are becoming increasingly popular due to their many reported health benefits. Eating a plant-based diet can help with weight loss, reduce the risk of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and high blood pressure, and increase longevity. Here are five reasons why eating more plants can be beneficial for your health:
Reason 1: Nutrient Dense: Plant foods are naturally full of vitamins, minerals, fiber,antioxidants and phytochemicals. Each of these are essential for good health, and consuming them in abundance on a daily basis helps to maintain optimal functioning of our body systems. A balanced plant-based diet is therefore much more nutrient dense than non-vegetarian eating patterns.
Reason 2: Heart Healthy: Plant-based diets have been linked to lower levels of bad cholesterol (LDL). In addition, they are typically low in saturated fat and don’t contain any trans fats which have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Plant foods also supply other key ingredients such as omega 3 fatty acids which help protect the cardiovascular system from atherosclerosis.
Reason 3: Cancer Protection: Plant foods may provide protection against certain forms of cancer due to their high antioxidant content. The antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables fight off free radicals which can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of tumors. Eating a variety of phytochemical-rich plants will ensure that you get a broad selection of antioxidants which may help guard against cancer.
Reason 4: Weight Loss Potential: Following a plant-based diet has been linked to successful weight loss outcomes because these foods tend to be lower in calories then animal products while still providing an impressive amount of nutrition per serving. Plants also often contain dietary fiber which helps promote feelings of fullness so it is easier to eat less while still feeling satisfied after meals.
Reason 5: Environmentally Friendly Option: Eating more plants is not only good for your own health but it can also benefit our planet too! Plant foods require less land and water compared to raising livestock so opting for vegan options whenever possible can help reduce your environmental footprint while still nourishing your body adequately.
In conclusion, there are many advantages associated with choosing to eat a plant-based diet over one that contains animal products. By consuming mostly fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains you can greatly improve your overall wellbeing while supporting sustainable farming practices too!
